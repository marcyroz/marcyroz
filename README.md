#Hi! Welcome to my profile 😼💻
## My name is Marcelly but you can call me Marcy :)

If you'd ask about me, I'd say how i'm currently in college studying to become a great front-end developer! I love this field, especially cause I can let my creativity fly as much as i want! However, of course, in terms of what is most productive in the industry ✨
🏆 My highest goal in the moment is to learn React JS and find a position that gives me the opportunity to learn even more, cause we can aways absorb more knowledge!
